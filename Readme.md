Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
-----------------------------------
SVD is a mathematical techniquethat allows us to decompose a matrix (ie. an image) into three other matrices of components that allow us to reconstruct the original
as a kind of compressing algorithm. In this example using R it is used to compress and uncompress an image.
